# Japanese & English citation styles
## Introduction
These are Japanese & English Citation Style Language (CSL) files. CSL files are used by citation management softwares such as Zotero and Mendeley to render citations and bibliography according to journals and publishers' guidelines.

## Download
Head to [Lit of styles](#list-of-styles). Right click on the style you want, then save to your computer.

## Installation
For Zotero
1. Open Zotero
2. Double click on the file you just downloaded & confirm
3. An error will show (only for Japanese)
    - It is fine to click OK (This error shows because we use one file to generate both Japanese and English, which is not expected by the software)

For more information on installation on Zotero head to [the official website](https://www.zotero.org/support/styles). 

## Reinstall
Repeat the steps from [Installation](#installation) above.

## Use

If you write in English only, choose the English style and use normally.

If you write in Japanese or Japanese with English (or other languages) references, follow the instructions below.

* Add "ja" to the language field of all Japanese entries.
* Add the kana reading of the author's name in the note field (extra field for Zotero) for sorting following aiueo order.
  - name-kana: ふりがな
  
If you do not follow these steps, Japanese will not render properly.

## Limitations
Due to limitations of the processor, the following should be edited by hand for now. 
* Names in Katakana are displayed like Japanese names (セイメイ), without punctuation.
* It is not yet possible to put a space between family name and given name (姓 名)
